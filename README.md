# Bank-Marketing - Customer Conversion Prediction
Using machine learning to forecast which customers are most likely to convert during a bank campaign.

## Project Purpose
Identify high-value customer groups, design tailored engagement strategies through phone calls, and apply predictive scoring to maximize campaign effectiveness and conversion rates.

## Key Questions
Question 1: Which customer groups represent the high potential value in this campaign?  
Question 2: How can predictive modeling help estimate individual purchase probabilities and guide resource allocation more efficiently?

## Results: 	
- Successfully segmented 4,700+ customers (41% of 11K+ dataset) into 3 behavioral profiles.
- Achieved 90%+ prediction accuracy with segment "Rising Achievers" as primary target (2,500+ customers).
- Built scoring system that can segment customers into 4 risk categories, and prioritize top 11% prospects (500+ high-value customers) for optimized campaign resource allocation.

## Key Steps
1. Data preprocessing
2. Data analysis
3. Modeling and evaluation
4. Apply model to Test data

## Tools & Technologies
- **Languages**: Python
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, WOE/IV
